  Hello my name is Jim Jacob, I am a 22 year old programmer that primarily focuses on web development. Programming is a passion of mine that I have
been doing non-stop for the past 7 years, since I got my first computer at the age of 14. 
  I love undertaking and solving all kind of problems that have to do with software. If a solution exists, I will find it.
  
You can contact me using this email: jimjacobharris@gmail.com

Thank you for time !
